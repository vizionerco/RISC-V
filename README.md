About Reposity Owner
After 34 years of my career, I retired from my regular job in 2023. 
Now, I do part time consulting services to interested parties, while I do work on projects that interest me more than a regular work. 

In my career I dealt with very diverse fields of engineering: Academics, C/C++ desktop programming,  embedded systems, analog circuit design, 
DSP algorithms, VLSI/FPGA design, underwater acoustics are to name few. 
I’ve always enjoyed designing controllers and processors with generic HDL for VLSI or FPGA. 
So, as my personal project to work on, I decided to design RISC-V cores with different capabilities. 
Having some defense sector background, I find systems engineering approach very useful. 
That is why I started from requiremet analysis phase.
